  <p className="lead">In JavaScript, the term "card" doesn't refer to a specific built-in concept. Instead, it typically refers to a UI component â€” a visual content box often used in web development to display grouped information like a product, user profile, or blog post.</p>
  <hr className="my-4"/>
  <p>It's a design pattern, not a JavaScript feature. Cards are built using HTML + CSS, and JavaScript is used to make them interactive (e.g. clicks, animations, data updates).</p>
